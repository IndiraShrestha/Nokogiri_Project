# Database Update Helper
---

### Synopsis
---
This project was created as part of partner project while at ####[Startup Insitute](https://www.startupinstitute.com/). 

### Detail
---
As a part of curriculum at Startup Institue students are assigned a partner company usually a startup company in and around boston area and work with them on a project. I was part of the AdmitHub who had just recently acquired Reference Service Press(RSP). 

RSP is a highly respected authority on scholarships and aligns with AdmitHubs business goal of helping students easily find the scholarships and financial aid advice they need to attend college. Traditionally RSP has shared its knowledge via printed books. 

Our Objective was to create a streamlined process for editing, creating, marketing and selling their books on scholarship. As a student of web dev track, I was focused on updating and maintaining their database. One of the ways, we could do a quick check for the database is to see 
    - if the weblinks are still working
    - if the response on title is "Page not found"
    - if the name of the scholarship is mentioned on the webpage

James and I worked on building the program to assist AdmitHub with this task.
